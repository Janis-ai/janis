# Janis reboot — agent notes

## Stack

npm workspaces monorepo: `apps/api` (Hono + Drizzle, PGlite dev / Postgres prod),
`apps/web` (React + Vite PWA), `packages/shared` (zod contracts), `packages/sdk`.

## Dev servers

- API: `npm run dev -w apps/api` → http://localhost:8787 (tsx watch)
- Web: `npm run dev -w apps/web` → http://localhost:5173 (vite, proxies /api + /auth)
- Login: `admin@janis.local` / `janis-admin` (env-overridable seed)
- Demo agent: `npm run demo-agent -w apps/api` (needs built packages/shared + sdk)

## Verify after every change

1. `npm run typecheck` (root — all workspaces)
2. `npm test -w apps/api`
3. `./scripts/smoke.sh` — checks web 200s, API health, login, all key endpoints,
   and that the SSE stream delivers a live event. Run this **before telling the
   user to reload the Devin preview** — it catches dead servers, CORS breaks,
   and endpoint regressions.

## Caveats

- SSE check needs an existing conversation to trigger a bus event.
- Slack features need SLACK_CLIENT_ID/SECRET/SIGNING_SECRET + a public API URL.
- Devin preview proxies :5173 — API CORS echoes localhost/127.0.0.1 origins.

## Gotchas
- Do NOT run the API with .pglite inside an iCloud/Dropbox-synced dir — file sync corrupts the live DB. This repo is under iCloud Drive, so apps/api/.env sets PGLITE_DIR=~/.janis/pglite.
- Only ONE tsx watch may run against a PGlite dir at a time; kill extras (pkill -f "tsx watch src/index.ts") before restarting.

## Billing / Stripe

- Plans live in apps/api/src/lib/plans.ts (base + included msgs + overage/1k; free hard-caps).
- apps/api/.env runs LIVE mode (sk_live + live price ids). Test-mode equivalents are kept alongside as `*_TEST` vars — swap them back for local billing work.
- Live webhook endpoint we_1UHwWgLuGzRk7fCQQpisSIEG → https://app.janis.ai/billing/stripe-webhook (created via API 2026-09; the old janis.ai endpoint was disabled and deleted). Test mode has its own endpoint at janis.ai. Local dev uses `stripe listen --api-key $STRIPE_SECRET_KEY_TEST --forward-to localhost:8787/billing/stripe-webhook` (the whsec it prints goes in STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_TEST).
- Customer Portal configured on both modes: card updates, invoice history, immediate cancel.
- Meters (both modes): janis.messages (1 per stored message) and janis.llm_micros (billed micro-USD incl. margin per LLM call). BYOK agents (config.llm.api_key or base_url set) record usage events at costMicros=0 — never metered. Metered prices: test starter/pro/scale = price_1UFwMP…gq7Q/…XxYp/…HBJcnK, llm = price_1UFwMQ…C8tOE; live starter/pro/scale = price_1UFwMR…HYZq/…Zjls/…TkO, llm = price_1UFwMT…ion8. Checkout adds the plan's metered price + LLM price as extra line items.
- .env edits do NOT trigger tsx watch reloads — restart the API after changing env.

## Deploy (Cloud Run)

`./scripts/deploy-gcp.sh` — Cloud Build → gcr.io/janis-prod-mn/janis-api → Cloud Run
service `janis-api` (us-east1), serving web+API same-origin at
https://janis-api-696050206949.us-east1.run.app. PGlite data persists on GCS
bucket janis-data-janis-prod-mn via FUSE mount at /app/data (demo-grade — use
DATABASE_URL + managed Postgres for real load; keep --max-instances 1 with
PGlite: single writer only).

## Shared package

@janis/shared resolves to dist/ in all consumers (prod Node can't load .ts).
After editing packages/shared/src, run `npm run build -w packages/shared`
before typecheck/tests/dev.
